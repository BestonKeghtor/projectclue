                    <em>The main objective of the study was to investigate the effect of entrepreneurial activities on economic development. The study is a survey research and the main instruments of data collection are the questionnaire and the face to face interview with the management of some entrepreneur in Makurdi. Simple percentage were used in data presentation while, Chi-square (X2) used to test the hypotheses formulated and for data analysis. The study found out that there is no level of awareness on the part of government on the effect of entrepreneurial activities on economic development. As a result of these findings, it was recommended that Government at all level should as a matter of top priority make provision of basic infrastructural facilities such as good roads, electricity supply, adequate water supply and good health care facilities etc. The provision of these facilities will improve the activities of entrepreneur toward economic growth and development. It will also create job opportunities in the State, Good and sound government policy framework as well as programmes geared toward boosting the activities of entrepreneur should be another area of interest by the government. This will encourage free participation in the entrepreneurial activities and it will lead to poverty reduction in the economy. Finally, adequate provision of security network system to protect lives and properties is also considered as a recommendation. When government addresses these challenges, entrepreneurial activities will boost in all part of the State.</em><br><br>

                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            Generally, the need for entrepreneurship activities emerges out of the inability of adopted economic systems to bring the economy out of the cycle of poverty. For Example capitalism collapsed around 1929 when the great economic depression occurs. Keynes advocated for a new economic system based on government interference (Clark, 2006). The new system was successful in moving the economy to a higher level of prosperity. However, its fallacies were late exposed when the monetary school of thought led by Milton Friedman, who provided an alternative system emerges.<br><br>
                            Given this situation, the Nigerian stakeholders academicians etc, after many years of exhaustive deliberation on how to put the economy on the path of sustainable growth realized that entrepreneurship is the best alternative. It follows from the above that entrepreneurship is the best way to offer solution to the problem of stagnant economy.
                            It is on this note that efforts are been made to examine the effects of Entrepreneurial Activities on Economics Development of Benue State.<br><br>

                            The fundamental objective of this work is to look at the effect of entrepreneurship on the economic development of Benue State. Attempt was made to understand the reasons for entrepreneurship and also to illustrate further the performance of entrepreneurship as well as its contributions towards the economic transformation of Benue State economy.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            Despite the efficiency of entrepreneurial activities towards economic development, it appears that over the years it is yet to produce a meaningful result in the Benue State economy. It is however a general believe that the major reason why people engage in entrepreneurial activities in any economy is unemployment and poverty. This study therefore seeks to determine the effect of entrepreneurial activities on economic development in Benue State. Makurdi Local Government as a case study.<br><br>
