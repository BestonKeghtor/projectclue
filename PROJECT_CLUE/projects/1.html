This study adopted the ordinary least square multiple regression analyses, Pearson correlation co-efficient of determination to examine and appraise the relationship between information technology and the banking sector of First Bank of Nigeria. The findings show that Growth rate in computer technology cost, interest rate: (inter bank), inflation rate, total bank asset, total deposit, number and bank profits of First Bank of Nigeria. This study recommends that in order for banks to increase its profitability and carryout good operations the bank should be saddled with the responsibility of mapping out strategies and itemizing tactics to boost its capitalization.</em><br><br>

                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            The use of information technology, broadly referring to computers and peripheral equipment, has seen tremendous growth in service industries in the recent past. The most obvious example is perhaps the banking industry, where through the introduction of information technology related products in internet banking, electronic payments, security investments, information exchanges (Berger, 2003), banks now can provide more diverse services to customers with less manpower and much ease.<br><br>
                            Information technology is a powerful force that drives the world towards a converging commonality (Levitt, 1992). From the beginning of the human era, technology has been of the most essential and most important factor for the development of mankind (Coombs et al, 1987). During the last two hundred years, technological changes have often been related to economic growth in the forms of new types of goods and services Smith (1776) first wrote about technical changes in the form of new machines as some of the important causes of increasing incomes more than 200 years ago.<br><br>
                            Research shows that information technology affects financial institutions by easing enquiry, saving time and improving service delivery (ALU 2002). Information technology also provides solutions to the needs of modem societies in health care delivery, library services, education and communication networks within organizations etc. Seeing this pattern of growth, it seems obvious that information technology can bring about equivalent contribution to profit. <br><br>
                            According to Alu (2002), some banks in Nigeria have LANS (Local area network) in most of their branches but none of the banks have deployed home banking applications. As a result of the increased demand for customer deposits Nigeria banks especially the new generation banks have realized the imperative of good and prompt customer service. <br><br>
                            Also, due to the fact that some customers lost their deposits in the erstwhile technically insolvent or distressed bank customers have now become wiser, more discerning, alert and sophisticated with regards to choosing where it is safe to put their money and where they would be served promptly, preferably in a pleasant, courteous and friendly environment. Thus they have started looking at the level of services, with regards quality, speed and efficiency has become the major imperative. On the parts of the banks, they have realized that one way in which they can provide quality service is through the use of technology.<br><br>
                            Hence, there is a growing rate of adopting new technologies in Nigeria banking operations. Moreover, there is growing evidence that customers have started associating quality of service in a bank with the bank’s possession of an online, real time system. In fact, possession of such system is now judged to be the sine qua non of a high quality banking service, in Nigeria, so a bank to be perceived as providing high quality service, that banks have to have an information technology system, which it uses to deliver services to customers in a more timely, friendly and considerate manner at no extra cost to the customer.<br><br>
                            To most people, information technology in banks means 24 hours access to cash through an automated teller machine (ATM) or paychecks deposited directly into saving or checking account. But information technology in banking now involves many different types of transaction. Hence, it uses computer and electronic technology as substitute for check and other transactions. Many financial institutions use ATM or debit card and personal identification number (PIN) for this purpose. Some use other forms of debt cards such as those that require at the most the signature of the customer of a scan.  <br><br>
                            The problem here is that all the banks are trying to procure appropriate VSATS independent of one another. In other words, there is no collaboration between the banks in solving this very expensive technology and thereby providing a cost effective solution to the problem. It would also be fair to say that Nigeria banks are generally imbed with an overly competitive mind-set, which tends to foreclose the benefits of synergy of collaboration in solving most of their common problem. <br><br>
                            
                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            Banking industry in Nigeria has in recent times become highly competitive and the competition is expected to intensify as new players of local and global scope enter the industry. In an attempt to maintain their competitive edge as the terrain becomes more challenging to navigate, some banks have introduced information technology in one form or the other. From all indications, the nation’s banking environment can reasonably be said to be changing gradually from manual to an automated system with keenness and determination already being displayed by many banks towards information technology.<br><br>
                            Apart from making business processes easier and more accessible in banks, the introduction of information technology in Banking industry has brought with it series of innovations. The innovations have been manifested in many areas such as the introduction of automated teller machine (ATM), Smart cards, telephone banking, etc. Information technology in banks offers customers advantages such as speed and convenience. <br><br>
                            In spite of its benefits, information technology will pose a lot of challenge to the banking industry (Nigeria inclusive) and to regulatory or supervisors in the system. Some of the challenges will include system failure, customer protection, the loss of audit trait and legal issues including money laundering or cybercrime. Above all, information technology also presents some security challenges. The effort of the research will be directed to finding solutions to the following problems: <br>
                            1.	The change of information technology to the banking sector. <br>
                            2.	To attain the highest level of information technology in the banking industry. <br>
                            3.	Providing a cost effective solution, so that all banks can source for this very expensive technology in other to provide quality service to customers. <br>
                            4.	The present operating system of the banking industry and how information technology improves on business process making it easier and accessible. <br>
                            5.	To determine the basic impact of information technology. <br><br>

                            The result of this study will expose the impact of information technology to the banking sector which will assist policy makers to formulate policies that would help in improving the performance of the banking sector as a whole.
                            The banking sector being the mainstays of the financial sector of the economy is very important to the society and need to be critically looked into since the world at large is fast growing in technology. And this has high effect on the banking sector of the economy, which in turn effects the economic situation of the nation. This study will also give true picture of banks to the public irrespective of information technology facilities so that they will be aware of this innovation. 
                            The research work will also contribute to the body of knowledge and also serve as a reference material for those wishing to carry out further research on similar field of study.<br><br>
