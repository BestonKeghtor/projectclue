                    <em>The purpose of this research was to examine parents’ educational attainment and attitude to school are factors affecting their children’s performance in Biology. Six research questions were formulated to find the extent children’s’ performances in biology depend on their parents’ educational attainment and attitude to school. Also if there is difference in the performance of male and female children due to their parents’ educational attainment. Six null hypotheses were formulated and tested at 0.05 level of significance. A sample of 298 students were selected from a population of 5,960 students from 8 sampled schools out of 63 secondary schools located in Vandeikya, Konshisha and Ushongo Local government Areas of Benue State. Questionnaire were used to collect data. Mean and standard deviation were used to answer the research questions. Chi-squares were used to find significant differences in the mean scores of children academic performance in biology due to their parents’ educational attainment and attitude to school while t-test was used to find out whether there is significant difference in the mean performance of male and female children due to their parents’ educational attainments. Significant differences were found in some variable tested. Mothers’ attitudes have significant impact on their children’s academic performance (X2 = 1477.569, P = 0.023 < 0.05); mothers’ educational attainment has significant impact (X2 = 7.875, P = 0.049 < 0.05); There was no significant difference between performance of male and female and mothers’ educational attainments (t = 1.681, P = 0.093 > 0.05). But there was a mean difference of 0.08 in favor of female children due to their mothers’ educational attainment. Children’s performance significantly depend on their fathers’ attitude (X2 = 1245.621, P = 0.019 < 0.005. No significant difference existed between male and female performances and fathers’ educational attainment (t = 0.938, P = 0.348 > 0.05). However, fathers favor male children more than the females. Since there was mean difference of 0.05 in favor of male children. It was recommended among others that parents should be literate enough to set benchmark and assist their children for better performance in school. The parent – child relationship should be positive to promote children’s efforts and academic performance. Children should respect their parents for maximum support at home and in school. The whole society should provide children with guidance and counseling for maximum performance at home and in school.</em><br><br>

                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            Education is a process of teaching, training and learning especially in schools or colleges to improve knowledge and develop skill (Hornby, 2001). Education caters for the needs and aspirations of people in a country. This statement is supported by Anger and Tyav (2006), that education is a vehicle for socialization where values of society are transmitted from generation to generation. The development of any nation depends largely on the quality of education to produce competent human resources.
                            <br><br>Ezewu (1989) asserts that education is a fulcrum upon which national development revolves and remains the vehicle for social, economic, political, scientific advancement and a potent means of processing human products and achieving progress. Based on the importance of education in the society, it should be a co-operative venture of the government, parents and the entire community. Thus, the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the national policy on education states that education is the birthright and best legacy that a nation can give to her citizens. (FRN, 2004).
                            <br><br>Conscious of the vital roles of education, Nigeria like any other developing nation, is attempting to harness the vast human and material resources in process of education. Thus, the Nigerian Educational Research Council organized the first national conference, where the blue-print for developing relevant curricula and new national goals for all levels of education emerged. The conference among other things examined the role of science and technology in national development and also came up with a national philosophy of education and goals. For secondary education, the objective in relation to Science and Technology (S&T) was to provide trained manpower in the applied S&T, to equip students to live effectively in our modern age of S&T and to raise a generation of people who can think for themselves (Ogunleye,1999).
	                        <br><br>Science, according to Eriba (2002) is a way of looking at the world and asking questions about nature and generating knowledge that is testable and verifiable to explain the universe. Then technology is concerned with producing practical solutions to human problems. Therefore, Banke and Ada (2002) explain that there is an inherent expectation in every society that education, particularly science education, should equip an individual to be useful both to him and the society to which he/she belongs.
	                        <br><br>Gbamanja (2002) also agrees that science develops in students the processes of science and the ability to adapt to social and cultural societies by integrating the performance of modern science and technology with existing values and culture. In order to keep pace in the global market, the National Policy on science and technology gave priority to the teaching of science and technology in our educational institution in ratio of 60:40 in favor of science–based disciplines to humanities for enrolment in institutions of higher learning and insist on taking of a science course by secondary school graduate.
	                        <br><br>Thus, biology as a science of life occupies a unique position in the school curriculum. Biology is a pre-requisite to the study of many science related disciplines such as medicine, pharmacy, biochemistry, agriculture among others. Also biology education equips an individual with knowledge to comprehend the world around him and develop natural interest from the environment to structural, functional, adaptation, economic importance and general knowledge of living organism to more advanced concepts and principles of life (Kalu & Ndokwo, 2006).
	                        <br><br>Researchers, generally agree that a group of related familial factors at home exert significant influence on the educational aspirations and academic performance of adolescents (Garg, Kauppi, Lewko, & Urafinik, 2002). Among these salient factors are parents’ attitude, educational attainment, illiteracy, socio-economic factors, parental involvement by deliberate effort to reinforce improved academic performance; general academic guidance and support contributing to their home work, encouraging children to read, promoting school based activities such as attending PTA meetings and fund raising activities, peer, teacher influence and adolescent self-efficacy (Garg, Melanson & Levin, 2007). Also, Sanchez, Rayes and Singh (2006) identified negative domains within the family, such as low parental involvement, socio-economic status and educational level to explain Latino youths’ educational failure. They found that at least half of the variance in educational attainment was attributed to family background including parental attitude to schooling.
	                        <br><br>According to Aiken (2005) an attitude is a relatively enduring disposition or tendency to behave in a particular way towards peoples’ characteristic. Then all attitudes are beliefs that are emotional based on information about those characteristics in people or things around us. If those characteristics are favorable we have positive attitude towards them while unfavorable characteristics attract negative attitude. He supports the above definition of attitude as the individual’s tendency to react positively or negatively to some persons, situations, events or institutions of learning. Then it seems the level of education can influence parents’ knowledge, beliefs, values and goals about child rearing and schooling.
	                        <br><br>Abambeh, (2001) affirmed that the importance of parental attitudes to child’s progress at school seems to be firmly established. He stated that parents should visit the school often and wish their children to enjoy studies, know how they are getting on in their studies, and give a boost to their children’s educational progress. He concluded that children with ambitious parents with positive attitude to schooling tend to be “over achievers”. He further highlighted that such parents set high standards from an early age and were ambitious for their children. Parents’ presence during open days of schools helps in injecting positive motivation in what the child is doing in school. 
	                        <br><br>In the same vein, Shittu (2004) reported that quality of parents of a student goes a long way to predict quality of the satisfaction and provision of a child’s functional, survival and academic needs. The poor parental care with gross deprivation of social and economic needs of a child may lead him/her to truancy and may adversely affect their academic performance in school.
	                        <br><br>Thus, apart from governments’ efforts parents should be involved in making far reaching contributions in the educational process in matters of aims and objectives of education, selection of materials for curriculum development, assisting in administration, discipline and moral tone of the school. These can be achieved only if parents have positive attitude to schooling and better educational level to understand their roles and participate effectively in boosting the students’ academic performance since the school is an extension of the home and vice versa.
	                        <br><br>Academic performance also depends on students’ efforts and skills to reach the successful targets in schools. Students’ performance is one of the major determinants in assessing the quality of education. Teachers apply academic standards to students’ efforts and products which could be used to classify students into two subjective categories. High Achievers students whose academic achievements were credit and above and their performance described as good. Under Achievers: students whose academic achievements are judged as below the credit, their performance was described as poor.
	                        <br><br>Most scholars believe that parents are the basis of educational achievement (Danesy & Okediran 2002). On the other hand, children also have perception of their parents. Robless (2006) viewed perception as the opinion of an individual and an infinity judgment based on personal experiences and available information. Therefore, this research was to ascertain students’ perception of their parents’ educational attainments and attitudes to school as factors affecting their performance in Biology.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            When proper Biology education is denied to children, it may lead to numerous consequences. These include poor health, lack of knowledge on anatomy and physiology of their bodies which leads to improper body care, superstitious beliefs about causes of illnesses, unwanted pregnancies and abortions. Problem of malnutrition instead of balanced diet seems to be common due to illiteracy and low educational level of families. All these problems show that the society has not succeeded in the biology education of her youth in schools, since children constitute a significant population of the society. There is need for educated parents with positive attitude to schooling to provide the basic knowledge at home, financial and material support to children in school to boost their performance in biology.
                            <br><br>However, most parents seem not to care about the attitudes or performance of these children and the falling standard of biology education. It is in the light of this that, this research was interested in finding out the students’ perception of their parents’ educational attainment and attitude to school as factor affecting their performance in biology in Vandeikya, Ushongo and Konshisha local government areas of Zone A, Benue State.

                            <br><br><strong style="font-size: 20px">1.6 	Significance of the Study </strong><br>
                            The findings of this study will be of benefit to the students, parents, teachers and the general society.
                            <br>To the students, it may make them understand that parents have great role to assist them for better academic performance in school. With this understanding children should be obedient to parents and be serious with studies. The females also should compete with their male counterparts in all subjects.
                            <br><br>The findings will encourage parents to be literate, so that they can know the different ways and means to assist their children and the school in general. It may also make parents to appreciate educational values and help to foster them at home. Parents may develop positive attitude to schooling of all their children including the females.
                            <br><br>Teachers may identify some factors affecting students’ academic performance in biology in order to improve the quality of teaching and to enable students acquire the necessary skills, processes and attitudes in science. Teachers may understand the relationship between parents and school and encourage parents to participate fully in school activities.
                            <br><br>The general society may understand the important relationship between the home, school, and parents’ attitudes to schooling and educational level on academic performance of students especially in biology. So it is hoped that people’s negative attitude to schooling will improve and proper education of children will start from home and continue in school with full support from the society.

                            This study was focused on all biology students in senior secondary two and three. Their MOCK result which is a pre-examination to SSCE was considered from the selected schools.
                            <br><br>Students provided information on their parents’ attitude to school and educational attainment through questionnaire. The SS III students were used because they were in school and most of them were likely to know their parents enough to provide the information needed in this study.
