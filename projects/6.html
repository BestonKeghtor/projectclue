                    <em>This research work centred on the effect of drama method in the teaching of English language n primary schools in Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State. The study is a descriptive analysis of the role of drama method in effective teaching and learning of English language in primary schools in the area of study.	In order to carry out a thorough research work, questionnaires were used as the main instrument for data collection. The data collected were analyzed using frequency tables and simple percentage. The result of the findings clearly showed that pupils in primary school love any method of teaching that involves play. Secondly, drama method helps pupils to translate abstract ideas into concrete reality. It was therefore recommended that English language teachers in primary schools in the area of study should employ drama method in the teaching and learning of English language in primary schools because of its potency.</em><br><br>

                            INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
                            The reason why parents send their children to school is for them to get educated and to become useful to themselves and the society. In order to achieve this objective most parents in Nigeria sacrifice their children personal pleasure to ensure that their children get the best of western education. However, the inability of many teachers in primary schools to make effective use of teaching methods in inculcation sound knowledge in pupils tend to frustrate the efforts of parents. This is because teaching nowadays in Nigeria according to Unachukwu (2004) has become a “Jack of all trade”. It is generally believed by many not well informed persons that one does not need a professional training to teach. The peddlers of this information fail to realize that teaching a process that facilitates learning. For learning to take place the teacher must make deliberate effort, utilizing different techniques that have been tried out and provided to be effective, in order to ensure that the pupils learn. This unique effort made by the teacher to ensure that the child acquired learning is called “teaching method”
                            <br><br>Onwuka (2004) defines teaching method as the process of course of action or a method of operation which varies according to circumstances. It involves actions undertaken by the teacher and the pupils to promote learning. In the classroom situation, the teacher uses different procedures and methodology to convince the child to learn what he or she is taught. Drama method is one of the teaching methods which a good teacher uses to ensure that pupils learn effectively what they are taught.
	                        <br><br>Hornby (2004) defines drama as a play considered as a form of literature. All primary pupils enjoy activities in the form of drama, especially those that can involved. This is so because drama helps to sustain children’s attention and enable them to question issues as they arise. Children can be asked to dramatize how people in the society are governed or the effect if cigarette smoking. When they do this, their learning becomes more realistic and with more lasting effect.
	                        <br><br>A whole lot of things can be said about dramatization in the teaching and learning in primary schools, but the major concern of this project work is to find out the effect of drama method in the teaching and learning of English language in primary schools in Makurdi, Local Government Area of Benue State.
                            <br><br>

                            <strong>1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            Education according to Anyanwu (2004) is one of the greatest investments in Nigeria today contrary to the situation four decades ago. As an investment, nit requires the efforts of all and sundry to ensure its success. In fact the popular saying “all hands on deck” is not applicable to any other sector in Nigeria more than in education. The realization of the importance of education, especially primary education to the technological and socioeconomic development of the country has raised so many challenging issues. These issues range from poor funding of primary education irregular payment of primary school teachers’ salaries, dilapidated primary school structures and the rest of them.
	                        <br><br>However, it is not the intention of the researcher to hold broad discussions all these problems facing primary education in Nigeria, but the main concern of this project is to examine how drama which is the independent variable in this project can be used to improve effective teaching and learning of English language in primary schools in Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State.
	                        <br><br>The application of drama method in effective teaching and learning of English language has become very necessary because learning according to Unachukwu (2004) is of great concern to enhance effective teaching and learning in primary schools, teachers usually apply some methodologies which primary schools teachers use in the teaching and learning of English and other subjects in primary schools. Dramatization is an important teaching method because all primary schools pupils enjoy activities which involve plays. Drama method of teaching and learning provides an opportunity for school children to gainfully involve in the lesson and to show case their abilities. It helps to generate keen interest in pupils and enable them, to retain what is learned (Ogunsanya 2007). Dramatization is child centered and provides ways for discovering abilities in children. The advantage dramatization in teaching and learning of English language and other subjects in primary schools are so enormous that a good teacher cannot afford to leave put drama method in his or her methods. It will be pertinent to note here that the coming of western education in Nigeria which gave rise to all the various teaching method in primary school was made possible by the early Christian missionaries from Europe, Sierra Leone and the United States of America. These early Christian Missionaries were the Church Missionary Society (CMS). The Methodist Church and the Roman Catholic Church (Fafunwa 2003). 
	                        <br><br>As early as the 1485, the Portuguese traders had landed at Benin, by 1515. Spasmodic missionary activities had started in Britain when some catholic missionaries set up a school at the Oba’s palace. The school was meant to train the Oba’s children and sons of hid palace chiefs. But the school was short-lived because of Atlantic slave trade (Elewa, Ukagwu and Nwachukwu 2009). However, despite the failure of the first missionary attempt by the Portuguese to establish a school at Benin in 1515. The second missionary attempt yielded result. In 1840’s some of the rescued slaves who were on a trading expedition from their new homes in Sierra Leone found their way back to Egba land their ancestral home. Some moved up to the new capital Abeokuta. At Abeokuta these freed slaves told their kith and kin baffling stories about their experiences as slaves. After hearing these stories, some of the Egba people become interested in the white man’s way of life. They therefore sent messages to the missionaries in Sierra Leone to send the man to bring light to them. In response to these appeals the missionary sent Rev. Thomas B. Freeman to Badargry in 1842. With the local people he built a mission. Rev. Thomas B Freeman left behind at Badagry, Mr/Mrs De Graft of the same mission to continue the work of evangelization. This couple opened the first school at Badagry called Nursery of the Infant Church. The opening of this school which of course served as teacher’s training institute in Nigeria marked the introduction of western education and teaching methods in Nigeria primary schools (Fafunwa, 2003).

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            The inability of many pupils in primary schools to read and write has become a source of worry to parents as well as stake holders of primary education in Makurdi local government area of Benue state. This inability of many pupils to read and write especially pupils in public primary schools in the area of study made worst by the lackadaisical attitude of teaching to work. Many primary school teachers hardly teach their pupils. Those that teach do no adopt the right teaching method that will promote understanding of the lesson taught. The outcome of all these, is the inability of pupils to read and write.	The area of reading and writing in English language are areas that cannot be neglected in the teaching and learning of English language in primary schools. This is because there are every important in the development of pupils’ reading and writing skills. However, majority of the pupils in primary school today cannot read and write in good English due to a number of factors and it is not the intention of the researcher to hold back discussion on all of them here. But suffice it to say that one of the problems militating against pupils’ inability to read and write effectively in English language is poor teaching method.
                            <br><br>The uses of drama method in the teaching and learning of English language in primary schools will help learner to learn faster. This is because pupils hardly forget what they can see and touch. The major concern of this project work therefore is to find out the teaching and learning of English in primary school, in Makurdi local government area of Benue State.
