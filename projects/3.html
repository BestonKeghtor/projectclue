                    <em>The purpose of this research was to examine the causes of Fulani-Tiv crisis, the extent to which it has affected the rural development of Gwer-West local government area and various measures to prevent further occurrences of the crisis. Three research questions were formulated as well as a null hypothesis to test at 0.05 level of significance whether the crisis has any significant effect on rural development of the local government. A sample of 396 persons was selected from a population of 48,858 from 6 sampled council wards of the local government. Questionnaires were used to collect data. Simple percentages and logistic regression analyses were used to answer the research questions. It was recommended among others that the government should provide tight security and further aid the reconciliation process by ensuring that perpetrators of the conflicts are identified, including members of the security forces, and brought to justice. Furthermore, government should provide reserved areas for cattle rearing which should be wide enough to meet the demand of Fulani herdsmen in feeding their cattle at all seasons, so that the devastation of farm lands will be curtailed.</em><br><br>

                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            The world-wide goals of sustainable growth, job creation, poverty reduction and equitable development cannot be achieved unless directly tackled at the rural level. Rural areas hold considerable potential for high return activities and productive livelihoods. The global economy comprising of developed and developing countries roots its foundation from the rural areas. These rural areas inhabited by the bulk of the world’s population serve as the base of the production of food and fibre. They are also the major sources of capital formation for the economy, and a principal market for domestic manufactures (Olantunbosun, 1975). In general terms, the rural areas engage in primary activities that form the foundation for any economic development.<br><br>
                            Two thirds of Africa’s population live and work in rural areas, which offer huge land surfaces, and agriculture represents 65 percent of jobs in Sub-Sahara. Yet, rural areas have been undervalued by governments, international development lenders and policy advisers. As a result, per capita food production has barely grown over the last 50 years, agriculture only represents 17 percent of Sub-Sahara’s GDP, and its productivity is low and even declining. It is not surprising that over 60 per cent of rural people live in extreme poverty, and many flee to the cities, where they usually swell the ranks of the unemployed or the informal workforce (Gilbert, 2014).<br><br>
                            Rural development is aimed at improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in the relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas. It has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers. The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Rural development takes a multi-dimensional process by which the productivity, income and welfare, in terms of health, nutrition, education and other features of satisfactory life of rural people can be improved upon or transformed. (Okide, 2013)<br><br>
                            In Nigeria, larger percentage of the populace inhabits rural areas which are characterized by primitive agricultural system, low per capita income, high level of illiteracy, ignorance, low standard of living measured by food and nutrition level. Inadequacy or non availability of health, education, housing, recreation facilities and good security also envisages the rural areas. Over the years, the problem has been how to make rural development sustainable. Towards this end, a number of development approaches have been pursued by the various governments in Nigeria. These consist mainly in the establishment of projects, programmes, and capacity-building institutions. (Williams, 1994).<br><br>
                            Some of the government programmes aimed at developing the rural areas in Nigeria as stated by Olaseni (2004) include the National Accelerated Food Production Project (NAFPP) launched in 1973 and replaced by Operation Feed the Nation Programme in 1976, The Agricultural Development Projects (ADP), The River-Basin Development Authority (RBDA), and The Green Revolution in 1980. These were impact-making agricultural strategies to increase food production in specific areas and sub-sectors of the agricultural economy, to mobilize the nation towards self-sufficiency and self-reliance in food production so as to raise income levels and standard of living of the rural populace. <br><br>
                            The basic objective of rural development essentially is to organize, develop and utilize available resources in such a manner that enables the rural dwellers to meet their basic needs and access social facilities without affecting their physical environment (Adeyemo, 1989). He further summarized these objectives as; the increased production and diversification of economic activities, development and utilization of available local resources, increased rural incomes, reduced national expenditure on food crops and raw material, provision of facilities and services among others.<br><br>
                            As one would expect, Gwer West local government area in a crisis-free situation coupled with its natural resources, potentials and the development programmes by the government will possibly attain such objectives leading to a boost in national income.<br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            Various studies have shown that about 80 percent of the total population in Nigeria work and live in the rural areas. Nonetheless, the emphasis of government has been on the planning and development of urban areas to the detriment of rural areas. The Nigerian rural environment is generally characterized by low level of infrastructural development because of the dispersed settlement pattern; facilities are difficult, if not uneconomical to be provided. Previous efforts of government are disjointed, uncoordinated and devoid of appropriate physical planning and sound concepts.<br><br>
                            The provision of rural infrastructure has for long been a government concern and the federal, state and local governments have tried in different ways to tackle the rural infrastructural problems. The synthesis of government activities reveals that during the past few years, series of constructive programmes and far reaching actions were taken by the government to combat rural infrastructural problems, which are far from being solved due to flaws surrounding the strategies adopted.<br><br>
                            Since 1962, Nigeria has spent and is still spending billions of Naira toward execution of the five National Development Plans in various development programmes.  But within five decades of political independence, the conditions of rural communities have virtually deteriorated. These events could be explained on the structural defects contained in the plans, especially with regard to the allocation of the highest percentage of the resources to a very tiny stratum of the population and thereby constituting a serious diabolical situation of the Nigerian state and economy.  The authors and implementers of these plans have completely misconceived what development entails, except that which suggests the physical erections of structures, building of institutions and the likes. (Abass, 1993).<br><br>
                            Despite the several National Development Plans embarked upon by various governments, insecurity has constituted the major problem of rural development since thousands of people have lost their lives, maimed or displaced from their communities as a result of crises. This has disrupted the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas within the Nation. (Alimba, 2014)<br><br>
                            It is in this light that, the research is interested in finding the effects of the Tiv-Fulani crisis on rural development of Gwer West Local government area.<br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.3	Objectives of the Study</strong><br>
                            The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of the Fulani-Tiv crisis on rural development of Gwer-West Local Government Area.
                            The specific objectives are as follows:<br>
                            i)	Find out the major causes of conflict between the two nations<br>
                            ii)	Examine the impact of the crisis on rural development in the study area.<br>
                            iii)	Determine various ways to avoid future clashes between Tiv and Fulani in Gwer West.<br><br>
                            
                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.4	 Research Questions</strong><br>
                            This research put the following questions to consideration:<br>
                            i)	What are the causes of conflict between Fulani and Tiv nations?<br>
                            ii)	To what extent does the crisis affect rural development in Gwer West Local Government Area?<br>
                            iii)	How can future clashes be avoided?<br><br>
                            
                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.5 	Research Hypothesis </strong><br>
                            This research work is designed to test the null hypothesis (Ho) and alternative hypothesis (Hi) thus:<br>
                            <strong>Ho:</strong> 	The Fulani-Tiv crisis has no significant effect on the rural development of Gwer-West Local Government Area<br>
                            <strong>Hi:</strong> 	The Fulani-Tiv crisis has significant effects on the rural development of Gwer-West Local Government Area.<br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.6 	Significance of the Study </strong><br>
                            The situation of insecurity in the rural areas of Benue State has called for deliberate and painstaking action in order to achieve the desired goal of rural development. This is because rural development plays a vital role in aiding economic growth and development of the entire nation.<br>
                            The research work aimed at identifying the level of severity and providing possible solutions to the challenges being faced by the inhabitants of rural areas will be of great significance to the Ministry of National Planning and also the government since accurate result from this research will be used. This will achieve the goal of making the rural populace industrious hence building their intellectual capabilities and potentials.<br>
                            The findings from this study will be of significance to various security agencies in Benue state and Nigeria at large since it intends to expose the effects of crises on rural areas and possibly work out several means of controlling these crises so as to pave way for rural development.<br>
                            The study will also be of great importance to investors who would want to invest in the establishment of industries or other ventures like agriculture within Gwer-West local government.<br>
                            It is hoped that, this study will stimulate as well as constitute a challenge to other researchers in this area, and provide an avenue for further studies by both academic and other professionals since it is a current issue. This will aid better understanding of the effects of crisis on rural development in Nigeria and the globe at large<br><br>
