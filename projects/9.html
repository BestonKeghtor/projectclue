                    <em>This study highlighted the effect of rain attenuation on the 1 gigahertz (GHz) Long Term Evolution (LTE) band and proposed a fade margin constant of 8dBm for LTE deployments for regions in central Nigeria. The fade margin being an expression for how much margin there is in decibel (dB) between the received signal strength level and the receiver sensitivity of the radio is a major factor to be considered during network planning for better link quality and higher throughputs. A higher fade margin makes the receiver process unwanted signals which can lead to network outage. As such, a smaller fade margin can lead to significant decrease in network throughput due to reduced receiver sensitivity. As a result, appropriate calculations and simulations were performed to arrive at the total received power, losses due to rainfall and Doppler shifts for regions in central Nigeria using International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standards which results to appropriate fade margin values for use in central Nigeria. Fade margins vary for different locations and environmental situations and as such are different for every geographical location. Furthermore was the study of the effect of Doppler shifts on network throughput using the transmit diversity technique. The advantage of this technique is that multiple antennas can be installed at the base station making it economical. Simulations were performed using the Extended Pedestrian, Extended Vehicular and Extended Typical urban delay profiles with maximum Doppler frequencies set at 5, 70 and 300Hz respectively. Results showed that the higher the Doppler frequency, the higher the number of errors leading to a decrease in network throughput. </em><br>

                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            Demand for faster and more reliable networks has become paramount especially in the early 2000s. Attenuation due to rainfall and Doppler shifts during signal propagation causes significant drop in network throughput especially on higher frequencies. This study highlights the effect of Doppler shifts on network throughput and proposes an appropriate fade margin for use within central Nigeria. Amongst the many methods of combating effects due to rainfall and Doppler shifts, of paramount importance is the use of adequate fade margins and antenna diversity.  
                            <br><br>Antenna diversity is one of the most common techniques used in Long Term Evolution networks. It is the method which uses two or more antennas either at the transmitter or at the receiver in order to increase network throughput. The use of either multiple antennas or receivers comes with many advantages which includes a higher data rate and better signal power. This, however, comes with a prize. The higher the data rate and modulation scheme used translates to a higher number of errors experienced during signal transmission. Also, the higher the speed of the signal, results to a higher chance of Doppler shift affecting signals. By using the space time block code transmit diversity technique, the bit error rate (BER) can be calculated by comparing the received signal with a delayed version of the same signal. The Doppler Effect is an increase or decrease in the frequency of sound, light, or other waves as the source and observer move toward or away from each other while fade margin is an expression for how much gain there is in decibel between the received signal strength level and the receiver sensitivity of the radio. Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks use orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in the downlink and single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) in the uplink. OFDM works by dividing the whole system bandwidth into subcarriers which are orthogonal to each other. OFDM is very resilient to fading and is also bandwidth efficient (Alamouti 1998). As signals get propagated through the channel, they experience Doppler shifts due to the speed of the signal which causes a loss of orthogonality between subcarriers resulting to interference thereby causing a drop in network throughput. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has specified three delay profiles for the multipath delay channel namely the Extended Pedestrian (EPA) delay profile, the Extended Vehicular delay profile (EVA), and the Extended Typical Urban delay profile (ETU) with maximum Doppler frequencies as 5Hz, 70Hz and 300Hz respectively. As the Doppler frequency increases, it is expected that throughput drops due to an increase in the number of collisions between subcarriers. Transmit diversity employs multiple antennas at the transmitter. The disadvantage when using transmit diversity is at the receiver where multiple copies of the signal can arrive out of phase leading to destructive interference. This problem can be minimized by using multiple antennas at the receiver but is uneconomical as it would require each mobile equipment to have multiple antennas installed.

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            The receiver sensitivity is the minimum input signal required to produce a specified output signal. All receivers are designed for a certain sensitivity level based on requirements. The higher the receiver sensitivity the more prone the receiver would be to process signals it is not interested in. On the other hand, smaller receiver sensitivity leads to lower power which decreases network throughput. This leads to a situation as to how much margin in decibel-meter (dBm) should be set between the received signal strength level and the receiver sensitivity of the radio. Adequate fade margins vary based on base station location and rainfall rate for the given location.

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.4	 Ojectives of the Study</strong><br>
                            In order to estimate the performance for the network setup in the presence of low, medium and high Doppler, as well as attenuation due to rainfall, indicators such as the bit error rate, total throughput and fade margin should be taken into consideration. To this aim, the following objectives have been outlined:
                            <br>1.	To propose an adequate fade margin constant for use during LTE deployment within regions in central Nigeria as well as highlight the effects of rain attenuation on the 1 GHz LTE band.
                            <br>2.	To investigate the Doppler frequency effect on network throughput using the transmit diversity technique.
                            <br>3.	To implement the 4 by 2 and 2 by 1 transmit diversity scheme as well as outline its advantages over both receive diversity and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) technique.
                            <br>4.	To highlight the throughput advantage from the implementation of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing/offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM/OQAM) Doppler correction technique.

                            The implementation of this research is based on the LTE Release 8, 9, and 10 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) specification. 
                            <br>1.	The platform is MATLAB Simulink 8.5 and NYUSIM v1.6
                            <br>2.	LTE downlink and a base station alongside several user equipment’s (UE) is considered. 
                            <br>3.	The focus is mainly on the physical layer and only PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) is considered.
                            <br>4.	Implementation of the transmitter and the receiver is on the LTE downlink only.
