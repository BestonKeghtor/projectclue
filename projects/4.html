                    <em>For centuries, people have felt the need to express their opinion on things and events happening around them. The urge to demonstrate and locate their own position in the spatial and temporal dimension naturally led to the process of documenting these events in various forms and by various media. Imaginative literature, penetrating under the surface of mere fact and documentary, proves to be one of the most vital tools to reflect the happenings around us. Novels thus rightfully have a say in documenting and mirroring realities of societies all around the world. However, it seems like other cultures are being left behind in the projection of their opinions and way of life. This research selects a novel of Tiv origin and presents the opinion of the author on things and events happening in the Tiv socio-cultural and religious background by so doing projecting the culture of the Tiv people of central Nigeria as presented in the novel.</em><br><br>
                    <p><strong style="font-size: 20px"><center>CHAPTER ONE</center><br>
                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            Culture is a term used by social scientists for a way of life. Every human society has a culture. Culture includes a society’s arts, beliefs, customs, institutions, inventions, language, technology and values. Culture produces similar behaviour as thought among most people in a particular society. This definition of culture is adopted by Ralph Linton who says: the culture of a society is the way of life of its members, the collection of ideas and habits which they learn; share and transmit from generation to generation. A people’s cultural heritage, therefore, is their way of life and, in a broad sense, their traditional behaviour including the ideas, acts and artifacts which are passed on from one generation to another.<br><br>
                            The preservation of cultural heritage is central to protecting a sense of who we are a meaningful reference in our culturally diverse world. However, Sekler (1992) states that:<br><br>
                            There are many ways in which a cultural identity is formed and maintained. Much of the process has to do with the intangible cultural heritage of a body of traditions and usages, rites, poetry, songs, and dance. A great deal of all these are passed on orally through generations. Consequently, its survival is always threatened… (p.85).<br><br>
                            World Bank has warned that: Cultural matrixes contain elements of the human collective memory- language and beliefs and are transmitted from generation to generation. Cultural references and signs are essential to the formation of national, group, and individual identities (p.10). Thus, tradition is the transmission or the passing down of elements of a culture (customs and beliefs) from one generation to generation, especially by oral communication.<br><br>
                            It is a curious and prevalent opinion that literature, like all art, is a mere play of imaginations, pleasing enough, like a new novel, but without any serious or practical importance. However, nothing could be farther from the truth, literature preserves the culture of a people; and culture – customs and beliefs – are the part of human life most worthy of preservation.<br><br>
                            Each time a language or culture is lost, we lose an irreplaceable and exquisite way of being. Culture is the highest expression of what it means to be human. It is a measure of our species’ contribution to planetary biodiversity. Cultural preservation emphasizes the need to protect, restore, and honour all forms of cultural diversity. It is a cornerstone of community.<br><br>
                            Cultural preservation recognizes the many strands of culture: language, stories, songs, dances, practical skills; buildings; sacred sites; artifacts; arts and crafts; relationships to the land, and forms of subsistence. It is therefore impossible to overestimate the practical importance of literature, which preserves these strands of culture from father to children.<br><br>
                            Traditional values have always been the main strength of the traditional African society and are naturally inherently derived from traditional social systems that people practically exercise in their livelihood. These values unify people of various communities until they were disturbed by external forces. The inbuilt natural intelligence of indigenous people which was guided by traditional virtues such as love and respect that enabled them to submit to traditional authority was highly expected from an average person in the community. This African cultural heritage is however, gradually being eroded away due to incursion with modernization. Our arts, language, food, customs, values and even the cloth we wear are almost going into oblivion.<br><br>
                            The collective memory of any society is of vital importance in preserving cultural identities, in bridging the past and the present and in shaping the future. The documentary heritage residing in African literature constitutes a major part of that memory and reflects the diversity of arts, languages and cultures of that society. Literature, therefore, continues to exist as an important source of contribution toward culture preservation. Consequently, our indigenous writers are gradually picking up the challenge to write on African cultural based issues with the aim of keeping the culture alive.<br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            The rich African cultural heritage is gradually losing its value, respect and identity. The present generation is focusing on outside changes with drastic influences and not realizing the damage caused on the withering of their cultural traditions. This research seeks to find ways of rescuing our culture from the cold hands of extinction.<br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.3	Objectives of the Study</strong><br>
                            The motivation for this project emanates from the researcher’s burning desire to participate in the ongoing clamour for renaissance of the African cultures in general and Tiv culture in particular. The general aim is to project literature as a veritable tool for preserving culture. This is however hoped to be achieved through the following specific objectives:<br>
                            1.	Identify literature as a veritable tool for preserving culture.<br>
                            2.	Fostering an understanding of the Tiv culture, among others.<br><br>
                            It aims at resurrecting the extinct rich aspects of Tiv culture and tradition that were however preserved in literature. By so doing, it is hoped that the present generation and even those to come will have a resource to appreciate the rich Tiv culture.<br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.6 	Significance of the Study </strong><br>
                            Preservation of cultural heritage has long been a challenge. The consequence of this challenge has been the loss of such cultures and the loss of culture leads to loss of identity. This research is a rescue mission to the drowning Tiv culture in the tide of modernity. The researcher hopes to achieve this by x-raying the critical aspects of the Tiv culture in the literary text of Tiv origin, Tyohdzuah Akosu’s <em>The Story of Adan Wade.</em><br><br>

                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.7 	Scope of Study </strong><br>
                            This research is set towards a goal. Our cultural heritage is gradually being eroded away due to incursion of modernization. Our arts, language, food and even the cloth we wear are almost going into oblivion. The collective memory of any society is of vital importance in preserving cultural identities, in bridging the past and the present and in shaping the future. In this study, the research is set to recommend literature as a tool that keeps a culture alive. The text selected, Tyohdzuah Akosu’s The Story of Adan Wade performs this function. It is of Tiv origin; in it the rich cultural heritage of the Tiv people of central Nigeria is preserved. At the end of this research work, anyone reading it will not see literature merely as an art for art sake; rather it will be seen as a bag that keeps a culture safe through ages.<br><br>
