                    <em>This study, “An Evaluation of Radio Broadcasting as a Tool for Rural Development in Makurdi, Benue State” isset out to examine the place of radio in rural development in Benue State. The rationale behind the study is to find out the prospects and challenges of using radio as a tool for rural development in Nigeria.  Communication generally, has a very crucial role to play in bringing about positive attitudinal change. The first requirement for the development of an information society that enables the effective use of the radio is wide spread access to the radio set and radio programmes. It was discovered that Radio can play a very significant role in the development of the rural and urban areas of any society. Several problems are however associated with the use of radio as tool for rural development in Nigeria; some of which are: communication related problems, message related problems, illiteracy, the use of English Language  by the electronic media, multiplicity of language in Nigeria, lack of audience  feedback, ownership problem, dearth of qualified personnel, urban-centred  development journalism and dearth of community based or vernacular  radio/telecommunication. The study concludes that radio is an important tool for entertaining, informing and educating the society, but that there are certain factors that hinder the effective use of radio for rural development. It therefore recommends, among, others, that radio stations in Nigeria should endeavor to use local dialects, especially when the radio programme is aimed at the rural dwellers and that there is the need to establish community radio stations that will be closer to rural dwellers.</em><br>

                            INTRODUCTION<br>
                            1.1 Background to the Study</strong><br>
                            Rural areas generally refer to areas in a country that are not fully developed. They are areas in a nation where you still have high traditional lifestyles that cannot be found in the urban areas or centres. Udoaka (1998: 49) avers that when the word ‘rural’ is mentioned in Africa, certain things are conjured in our minds. These images, according to Udoaka centre on acute un-development and poverty and they manifest themselves in the form of bad roads, lack of water supply, poor housing, poor sanitation and high rate of illiteracy. Udoaka further observes that the word brings to mind geographic locations in African, with populations of hungry, wretched looking people and stunted, kwashiorkor riddled children. It conjures the image of a people, who suffer in the farms, from morning to evening, but whose harvest is not commensurate with the efforts and time spent; it conjures the image of people who are starving, eating at best, once in a day after returning from the market. 
                            <br><br>Rural areas are such areas that lack the necessary infrastructure to make a meaningful living. They lack infrastructure like good roads, electricity, portable water, good market, banking institutions, good schools, health centres, etc. Those in the rural areas need to go to urban areas whenever they need such infrastructures. For example, people in the rural areas normally go to the towns and cities whenever they need healthcare services. This explains why Anaeto and Anaeto (2010: 12) argue that what is seen in the rural areas in Africa is the picture of poverty, unemployment, hunger, non-availability of infrastructure, illiteracy, lack of basic social amenities, like portable water, good roads and hospitals, etc.
                            <br><br>In the same vein, Aderanti (1982), cited in Asemah (2011) notes that living conditions in the rural areas are relatively poor. Colgate (2009), cited in Nwabueze (2010) defines a rural community as an area where people’s living condition is very poor. Rural community as noted by Colgate, cited in Nwabueze (2010) is better defined by looking at its characteristics, which include high level of illiteracy, low productivity, cultural homogeneity, one way of communication and absence of infrastructure, among others. 
                            <br><br>From the foregoing therefore, the rural areas are the villages and the communities that are outside the cities, towns and state capitals in a country. Contrary to what is obtainable in the urban areas; closeness of the people to the natural environment, greater social homogeneity, smallness of the communal aggregates, predominance of agricultural occupations and relative sparse population are what are discernible in the rural areas. Rural dwellers as disadvantaged people, whose houses seldom have running water and electricity, who live in extreme survival crises during rains, sun, wind, storms, harmattan, blizzards and drought, who possess no good roads, no portable water, are acutely isolated.
                            <br><br>Development as a concept is broad and therefore, does not subject itself to a single definition. It indeed covers a wide range of human endeavours. According to Asemah (2010), development is a process of change in attitude, social structure and general acceleration of economic growth, through reduction of poverty and inequality. Asemah (2011) notes that development in human society is a many sided process. At the level of the individual, it implies increased skills and capacity, greater freedom, creativity, self discipline, responsibility and material well being. The achievement of any of these aspects is very much tied in with the state of the society as a whole. Development involves the creation of opportunities for the realization of human potentials. Human beings have certain basic requirements, which must be satisfied so that they can properly function in the society.
                            <br><br>Development is seen as a changing process of knowledge, attitude and practices. It is in this context that the writer looks at development. Keghku (2005: 53) says that development generally implies change.
                            <br><br>Rural development is a concept that is used to describe a strategy that is designed to improve the economic and social life of the people in the rural areas. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) sees rural development as a process of socio-economic change, involving the transformation of agrarian society, in order to reach a common set of development goals, based on the capacities and the needs of the people (Owo, in Nwosu, 2007: 305). To Anibueze, in Nwosu, Aliede and Nsude (2005:36), rural development is a strategy that is designed to improve the economic and social conditions of a specific group of people, that is, the rural people. It involves extending the benefits of development to the poorest, among those who seek a livelihood in the rural areas. Rural development in general, is used to denote the actions and initiatives taken to improve the standard of living in non-urban neighborhoods, countryside and remote villages.
                            <br><br>These communities can be exemplified with a low ratio of inhabitants to open space. As earlier noted, rural areas are such areas in a country that lack necessary social amenities and infrastructures which are necessary for good living. Thus, there is the need for advancement and growth in these rural areas. The process of bringing about this advancement and growth in the rural areas is what is referred to as rural development. 
                            <br><br>Anaeto and Anaeto (2008: 1) observe thus: Rural development is a subset and an important part of national development. The idea and concern for rural development stems from the fact that majority of the people in the developing countries reside in rural areas. And the fact that development of the nation cannot be achieved without the development of the rural areas, even the developing countries have recently come to realise that unless the rural areas are well-developed, hardly would any meaningful development occur in these countries.
                            <br><br>The above assertion implies that rural development is part of national development, because when rural communities are not fully developed, the objectives of national development cannot be achieved. No country can boast of development when its rural communities have not been positively affected. This perhaps explains why Moemeka (1985: 9) explains that rural community education entails all activities like social, economic, educational, political and cultural, which touch on the lives of rural communities, knowledge of which is essential to purposeful living and progress. Onabajo, cited in Anaeto and Anaeto (2010) say that rural development entails interventions aimed at improved productivity, increased employment/ incomes for the target groups, as well as, minimum acceptable levels of food, shelter, education, health and housing. 
                            <br><br>Rural development according to Anaeto and Anaeto (2010) is a subset and an important part of national development. The idea and concern for rural development stems from the fact that majority of the people in the countries reside in the rural areas. Rural development efforts attempt to bring about self reliance in the rural communities in a country. New practices, ideas, innovations and methods, are introduced and when the rural dwellers accept these practices, it leads to economic gains.
                            <br><br>The concept of rural communication refers to the communication of news about rural areas. It consists of gathering newsworthy information about rural areas, packaging them in any form of journalistic writing and presenting them through a mass medium, most especially community media. Rural areas as earlier noted, are those areas that are totally based in the countryside. Such rural dwellers need information about the happenings in the society, so as to make them have a better living. Anibueze, in Nwosu, Aliede and Nsude (2005:38) avers that there is high rate of ignorance in the rural areas, beyond the poor physical development of such areas. The rural dwellers, Anibueze avers, “need to be empowered with knowledge of the fundamentals of population and development. This is because, the rural person becomes a nuisance when he or she does not have access to information; that is, basic information like modern family needs, nutrition, women rights, child rights, etc. 
                            <br><br>Communication will play a very significant role in helping the rural dwellers to live a worthwhile life. Thus, Nwuneli, Onuora, cited in Asemah (2011) argues that the rural dwellers need accurate information that will enable them to live and appreciate the activities of the government of the day. Nwuneli avers that since the rural dwellers are involved in the task of feeding the nation, they need information on several issues, including information on loan opportunities offered by the government and how to dispose off their farm proceeds. The rural dwellers need information about health care, weather, family planning, agriculture, etc. Nwuneli concludes his argument by saying that when the rural dwellers do not get the necessary information, in a well-coordinated fashion, they lose confidence in the government and the society at large. 
                            <br><br>The basic role of rural news reporting in any society is to foster development at grass roots level. By reporting news about the rural areas, development needs in these areas are made known to government, policy makers, change agents and stakeholders in the society (Nwabueze, 2010).
                            <br><br>Since the dawn of civilisation about two and half million years ago, every society’s growth, survival and continuity depends on among other things, a system of communication, through which people exchange ideals, feeling; an economic system for the production of goods and services, a health system to counteract disease and ensure human reproduction; a sociopolitical system to maintain control and order and a defence system to protect their territories against external aggression (Ugboaja, 1985). Ndolo (2006) observes that the partial success of modern mass media application for development projects, especially in the rural areas have resulted in various calls by communication scholars for rural development agents in the field, for a greater utilisation of indigenous communication channels for rural development. 
                            <br><br>According to Mogekwu (1990), the importance of rural radio in the introduction and sustenance of change in rural communities is undeniable, yet, successive Nigerian leaders have continued to utilise the Western mass media as the panacea for rural development, thus, there is a pressing need to improve and create more rural stations and create programmes that will meet the needs of the rural dwellers, thereby, bringing about national development. Radio can be used to mobilise the people at the grass root level for community development and national consciousness. No serious mass-oriented development programme, especially in rural communities in Africa ever succeeds without the active involvement of the people within the traditional system.
                            <br><br>Rural radio programme serves as a source of cultural, political, health and other educational and enlightenment programmes for the masses, leading them towards self-actualisation and national development. It is in this light that Okam (1981) submits that much of the failure that attends government mass–oriented programmes are traceable to the fact that policy makers at the national level fail to utilise this powerful and credible medium. 
                            <br><br>Radio can be used as a source of entertainment through arts and cultural festivals, musicals and dramatic performance, by local singing groups, masquerades and other music and drama groups. Radio is a medium of communication through which the individuals share the world around them and beyond their immediate environment. Radio in a country should influence social and, especially the political fabric. The social objective of using radio to mobilise people in Nigeria entails the area of education, information and entertainment. It is essential to provide through radio a kind of general education for people, irrespective of their educational background. This would be by a combination of formal and informal form of education. 
                            <br><br>Electronic media generally, according to Asemah (2011), provide the public with information. Electronic media serve as watchdog and do not abuse power. For education, there is thrill of learning from the source material. Radio as an electronic media, is expected to play the role of improving and changing social, cultural, political and technological thinking, which will, in the long run, have positive results on the process of rural development. This sensitive role expected to be played by radio is not far from the fact that it shows special qualities in disseminating information. Radio is so powerful that it brings political, economic and social news to any community or group of communities faster than other medium.
                            <br><br>Nwuneli, cited in Asemah (2011) in his own contribution on the role of radio, says, it has brought stimulus into the house, brings about competitions within families, thereby, grooming people who will contribute positively to the process of development. This fact agrees with the idea of Wigwe (1988) because of the emphasis on grassroots development. Salama (1978) notes that radio serves as an opinion leader in its news commentary and editorial. It mirrors the society in programmes like drama that present issues relevant to society in action which creates easy understanding and learning. It informs and educates the listeners in its discussion and documentary programmes. It entertains in its light programmes like musicals, sports comedy and dances. It also seeks to improve the society in its special occupational programmes geared towards agricultural business and other related areas. In essence therefore, radio can be employed to pass across vital information about latest techniques in agriculture, trends in agricultural extension services, etc, to the generality of rural dwellers. 
                            <br><br>Radio has been used to promote and support the cause for nature holding and to this end, Moemeka (1985) remarks that a local broadcast media like radio, if well managed, fully operated, will provide a continuous flow of educational information on all aspects that affect the lives of rural communities and also arouse their awareness with a view to changing what is detrimental to their lives. Thus, radio can be effectively used to promote health related issues. Radio educates, informs and enlightens the public of which the rural populace is included. Wigwe (1988:115) while writing on development communication says: The key role assigned to radio is to inform, educate, enlighten and entertain. The rural mobilisation and development process therefore, demands from the media the responsibility of making attainable enlightenment and aspiration of the rural populace. 
                            <br><br>Towards this end, the mass media support service, should therefore promote dialogue between the designers of rural development process and programmes. They will mirror to each group in a relentless manner, the programmes that have been implemented, how it has been accepted, its short coming, areas of improvement and the reactions of the beneficiaries. 
                            <br><br>All these coupled with the medium’s appeal to both the literate and illiterate audiences make radio the most fertile medium. Radio is the most effective medium of information at the grassroot level in Nigeria. It has assumed this powerful dimension because of many factors like, natural disposition, coverage area and cost. From the view point of Tafida (1986), cited in Asemah (2011), broadcasting (radio) is so powerful; it brings political, economic and social news to any community or any group of communities. 
                            <br><br>Wigwe (1988) believes that radio broadcasting has credible role to play in disseminating information to the masses at the grassroots level for development purpose. Information in this sense involves the social, political and economic aspects. Another contributor, Adaba (1987), cited in Asemah (2011) argues further that there is an essential communication role for radio broadcasting at the local level. Within an over-all national system, there is a clear need for radio broadcast to be used to motivate and mobilise the people at the grassroots, so that they can participate actively in the development of their own society.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <strong style="font-size: 20px">1.2 	Statement of the Research Problem </strong><br>
                            Information is central to all forms of human activity no matter the field, be it medicine, agriculture, tourism or engineering. There is the need for exchange of information to ensure completion of tasks. Inefficiency will be the results, where this exchange of information is slow or there is a break down. For this reason, information is regarded as a vital resource that needs to be properly developed, because it has boomerang effect on society. Consequently, a society that has poor communication and information infrastructure perpetually lags behind others that have efficient information infrastructure (Moemeka, 1985). Rural radio helps to achieve development in the rural areas, as issues of development are aired to audience in the form of various programmes and individuals are exposed to happenings in and around their society, through listening to these programmes. Communication serves as the basic element of interaction and information sharing in life. Communication creates pool of ideas, strengthens the feeling of togetherness, through the exchange of messages and translates through thoughts, into actions. 
                            <br><br>Radio communication educates citizens on new issues inherent in the society. For example, issues on politics, business, current affairs, etc, are aired to create awareness. Radio serves as an agent of social mobilization; people are moved to delivering a certain goal, based on their awareness of their rights
                            <br><br>Nigeria has the potential to develop all rural sectors of human endeavor more especially if information broadcasting services are fully enhanced in the rural communities. In spite of that, information is a basic resource for development level if structures are to be provided for effective access and utilization, entailing information capturing, coordinating processing and dissemination. Lack of information in the Nigerian rural communities is said to be a serious problem facing rural residence. Some of these problems are:  absence of infrastructure, which improves the quality of life, problem of portable water, electricity and food, feeder roads. The rural people have low purchasing power and standard of living. In particular the rural women are still not able to cater adequately for the basic needs of food, cloths shelter, lack of gainful employment, information for their family. They have limited access to social and economic infrastructure such as economic, health, portable water, sanitation and consequently, limited chance for advancing in their quality of life. Therefore, if the above problems are not being taken care of through communication, it will lead to a total destruction of the rural sectors. Therefore, It is against this background that the study seeks to evaluate radio broadcasting as a tool for rural development in Benue State.
